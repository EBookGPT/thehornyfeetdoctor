## The Wizard of Oz Parable

Once upon a time, in the Land of Feet, there lived a Horny Feet Doctor who had a reputation for being the wisest and most knowledgeable when it came to foot health. The people of the Land of Feet often sought her advice and guidance when it came to maintaining their foot health.

One day, a young girl named Dorothy from a far-off land arrived in the Land of Feet. She had been traveling for days and had grown weary and weary due to the long journey. As soon as she set foot into the Land of Feet, she went straight to the Horny Feet Doctor and sought her guidance on how to take care of her feet.

The Horny Feet Doctor greeted Dorothy and asked her about the purpose of her visit. Dorothy explained that she had been traveling for days and wished to learn how to prevent foot ailments and ensure that her feet remained healthy.

The Horny Feet Doctor smiled and said, "Dorothy, I can guide you on how to take care of your feet and prevent any foot ailments. However, you must take an active interest in maintaining your foot health."

Dorothy wondered how she could do that, and the Horny Feet Doctor replied, "by following the preventive measures I teach you and making them a part of your daily routine."

The Horny Feet Doctor then started teaching Dorothy about the various preventive measures that could be adopted to avoid foot ailments. She explained to Dorothy the importance of wearing proper footwear and maintaining good hygiene, along with performing foot exercises and stretching regularly.

Dorothy listened intently and found the Horny Feet Doctor's guidance to be enlightening. She vowed to follow the preventive measures suggested by the doctor and make them a part of her daily routine.

The Horny Feet Doctor smiled and said, "Dorothy, just like the yellow brick road that led you here, these preventive measures will lead you to a healthy and happy foot life. They may seem simple, but they are powerful enough to prevent the onset of any foot ailments."

Dorothy thanked the Horny Feet Doctor for her guidance and set forth to implement the preventive measures suggested by the doctor.

And just like that, Dorothy took the first step towards ensuring her foot health for years to come, thanks to the wisdom and guidance of the Horny Feet Doctor.

```python
def foot_care_routine():
  wear proper footwear
  maintain good hygiene
  perform foot exercises and stretching

foot_care_routine()
```

Remember, just like Dorothy, make the preventive measures a part of your daily routine, and you will be on the path to a healthy and happy foot life.
In the Wizard of Oz parable for Chapter 6: Preventive Measures, we included a code sample that reiterated the importance of following a foot care routine to maintain foot health. 

The code follows a very simple structure, using a function named "foot_care_routine" to define the three main preventive measures that one should adopt to avoid the onset of foot ailments. 

The three preventive measures suggested in the chapter are:

- Wearing proper footwear
- Maintaining good hygiene
- Performing foot exercises and stretching regularly

The function is defined using Python, where each preventive measure is included as a line within the function body. 

The function is then called towards the end of the chapter using the command `foot_care_routine()`. Doing so ensures that all three preventive measures are executed in sequence whenever the function is called.

In sum, this code serves as a gentle reminder that adopting preventive measures can go a long way in ensuring good foot health and preventing the onset of foot ailments. By making these preventive measures part of your daily routine, you are prioritizing your foot health and preventing the development of Horny Feet Syndrome.
